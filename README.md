# Sky Stacker iOS

Sky Stacker is an addictive, physics-based stacking game for iOS built using SpriteKit and an MVVM architecture. In this game, players tap to drop moving blocks onto a growing tower. With increasing difficulty, dynamic visuals, and a stylish 3D user interface, Sky Stacker challenges you to build the tallest tower possible!

## Features

Stacking Mechanics: Tap to drop moving blocks with precision. Earn bonus points for perfectly aligned drops.
Failure & Game Over: A fail counter tracks non-perfect drops, and the game ends after three failures.
Dynamic Difficulty: Block movement speed increases as your score rises, ensuring a challenging experience.

### Visuals & UI:
Dynamic Parallax Background: A blue background with large, 4Ã— scaled clouds that oscillate and trigger occasional thunder effects.
3D UI Elements: Score and fail counters are rendered with a 3D look (shadow effect) and positioned at the bottom of the screen.
Custom Game Over Screen: Displays a two-line message ("Game Over!" and final score) and a restart button with a 3D-styled rounded rectangle border.
